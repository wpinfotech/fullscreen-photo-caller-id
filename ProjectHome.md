# Full Screen Photo Caller ID for Android. #


This is a fun app that displays the contact picture in full screen on a incoming call.

I will upload the code here for everyone to access and improve upon. But that will take some time.

> ## In Version 1.0: ##
  1. User can select the image for a particular contact.
  1. Auto Complete text box for easily selecting a contact.
  1. Automatically disables the Key Guard lock and displays the pictures in full screen.

> ## Known Issues: ##
  1. Selecting an image of very large height and width will cause the app to crash. Pictures taken via phone camera is ok.

> ## Issues solved ##
> This is no more an issue (Rejecting a call will **not** work in Android 2.3 and above. [Just press back button so that this app goes off and ordinary call accept screen will be displayed). I have tested few phones and it works in some and not in some).
